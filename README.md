Share is a great idea. Make life easy and happy. We are creating the biggest abstract product platform,  another Amazon.<br />
We are human. We have two features:love and share.<br />
We share feelings--facebook raise.<br />
We share maps--google maps raise. <br />
We share car seats--Uber and Lyft raise. <br />

Today we will share abstract product(service)-- Misisipi(I named it) is raising. <br />

Cannot code<br />
Can write basic Hello World<br />
Fluency with basics like loops, variables, conditionals<br />
Create simple objects<br />
Create simple unit tests<br />
Considers program structure<br />
Codes for readability and expression of intent<br />
Uses advanced designs to separate pieces of program, like SOLID in OO for example<br />
Creates well structured, tested code<br />
Creates designs given user stories or requirements<br />
Considers deployment and operations issues<br />
Considers systems issues and architecture<br />
Considers security and data protection laws<br />
Understands where the business value lies in this system<br />

Mentors and coaches juniors<br />
Accountability for system design, performance and team output<br />
