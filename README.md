Share is a great idea. Make life easy and happy. We are creating the biggest abstract product platform,  another Amazon.<br />
We are human. We have two features:love and share.<br />
We share feelings--facebook raise.<br />
We share maps--google maps raise. 
We share car seats--Uber and Lyft raise. 
We share concret product-- Amazon raise. 
Today we will share abstract product(service)-- Misisipi(I named it) is raising. 
Everyone needs handy help, for example:AC needs repairing, lawn cut, house clearning, babysitter...... 
I will build a platform for abstract product(service), it is the second Amazon, the company will be growing up to more than one trillion market value.
My mission is: make lives easy and happy.
But now my company only one empployee, it is me, I cannot do all the things to create the platform. 
I only begin to create one small portion of it--AC repaired wanted.
Today's one step is tomorrow's big progress. 
Let's go to help people make lives easy and happy!
How do I mark the progress of a junior developer or a software engineer?

Great Question. For me it’s a rather vague sense of where they are on this path:

Cannot code
Can write basic Hello World
Fluency with basics like loops, variables, conditionals
Create simple objects
Create simple unit tests
Considers program structure
Codes for readability and expression of intent
Uses advanced designs to separate pieces of program, like SOLID in OO for example
Creates well structured, tested code
Creates designs given user stories or requirements
Considers deployment and operations issues
Considers systems issues and architecture
Considers security and data protection laws
Understands where the business value lies in this system
Influences stakeholders to accept revisions to time, cost, scope
Mentors and coaches juniors
Accountability for system design, performance and team output
