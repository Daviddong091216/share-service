Share is a great idea. Make life easy and happy. We are creating the biggest abstract product platform,  another Amazon.<br />
We are human. We have two features:love and share.<br />
We share feelings--facebook raise.<br />
We share maps--google maps raise. <br />
We share car seats--Uber and Lyft raise. <br />
We share concret product-- Amazon raise. <br />
Today we will share abstract product(service)-- Misisipi(I named it) is raising. <br />
Everyone needs handy help, for example:AC needs repairing, lawn cut, house clearning, babysitter...... <br />
I will build a platform for abstract product(service), it is the second Amazon, the company will be growing up to more than one trillion market value.<br />
Our mission is: make lives easy and happy.<br />
But now my company only one empployee, it is me, I cannot do all the things to create the platform. <br />
I only begin to create one small portion of it--AC repaired wanted.<br />
Today's one step is tomorrow's big progress. <br />
Let's go to help people make lives easy and happy!<br />

How do I mark the progress of a junior developer or a software engineer?<br />

Create simple unit tests<br />
Considers program structure<br />
Codes for readability and expression of intent<br />
Uses advanced designs to separate pieces of program, like SOLID in OO for example<br />
Creates well structured, tested code<br />
Creates designs given user stories or requirements<br />
Considers deployment and operations issues<br />
Considers systems issues and architecture<br />
Considers security and data protection laws<br />
Understands where the business value lies in this system<br />

Mentors and coaches juniors<br />
